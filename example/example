#execute commands executes command in specified shell in background and saves it output to "output variable"
#this for example executes pwd in bash and saves to "whereami"
sh x whereami pwd bash
#and now print output of pwd using output command
sh o whereami
#or
#convert to normal varible using link command
sh l whereami
#and use get command
sh g whereami
#pipe echo to lolcat
sh p "echo abc" lolcat
#pipe variable to lolcat with flags
sh p "sh g b" "lolcat -i"
#redirect echo to file "test"
sh r "echo hello world" test
#append another line to it

#read test using standart command
cat test
#and delete it
rm test
#combine variable b with variable whereami and print it
sh c echo b whereami
#set another variable
sh s hi "hello world"
#merge with variable b and save to variable "what"
sh m what hi b
#read it
sh g what
#combine what and whereami and figlet it
sh c figlet what whereami
#delete all variables
sh f
#try read variable b
sh g b
#set another few variables
sh s location 12
sh s time day
#basic if example
#this will print "hi" if location = time
sh i location time "echo hi"
#if else example
sh i location time "echo hello" "echo location != time" 
#clear
